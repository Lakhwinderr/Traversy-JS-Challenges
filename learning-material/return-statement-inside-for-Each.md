In JavaScript, the `forEach` loop does not exit the function when a `return` statement is encountered within it. The `return` statement inside a `forEach` loop will only exit the current iteration of the loop, not the entire function.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```javascript
function exampleFunction(arr) {
    arr.forEach((element) => {
        if (element === 3) {
            return; // This return statement exits the current iteration, not the function
        }
        console.log(element);
    });
    console.log("Function completed"); // This will always be executed after the loop
}

exampleFunction([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

In this example, when the `return` statement is encountered inside the `forEach` loop for the element `3`, it only exits the current iteration of the loop. The loop continues with the next element, and the function continues executing until it completes. So, the output will be:

```
1
2
4
5
Function completed
```

If you want to exit the loop early based on a condition, you might consider using a traditional `for` loop instead of `forEach`.
