In the expression str.toLowerCase().split(/\W+/), the split() method is used to split the string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter or regular expression. In this case, the regular expression /W+/ is used as the delimiter.

Let's break down the regular expression /W+/:

\W: This is a special character in regular expressions that matches any non-word character. Word characters include letters, digits, and underscores. Therefore, \W matches any character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore.

+: This is a quantifier in regular expressions that matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. So, \W+ matches one or more non-word characters in succession.

Putting it together, /W+/ matches sequences of one or more non-word characters.

When you use split(/\W+/):

It splits the string str into an array of substrings wherever one or more non-word characters are found.
For example, if str is "Hello, World! How are you?", it will split the string into substrings wherever there are non-word characters, resulting in the array ["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"].
So, the overall expression str.toLowerCase().split(/\W+/) converts the string to lowercase using toLowerCase() and then splits it into an array of lowercase words, excluding any non-word characters.
