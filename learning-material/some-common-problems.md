```
const win = new Set(7,11);
               ^

TypeError: number 7 is not iterable (cannot r
property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))
```
The Set constructor in JavaScript expects an iterable object as its argument, such as an array or another Set. It seems you're passing individual numbers directly to the Set constructor, which is causing the error.

To fix this issue, you can pass an array containing the numbers instead:

```
const win = new Set([7, 11]);
