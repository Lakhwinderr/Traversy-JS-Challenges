# Swich in JavaScript
In JavaScript, the `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It is an alternative to using multiple `if...else` statements when you have multiple conditions to evaluate.

Here's the basic syntax of the `switch` statement:

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  // Add more cases as needed
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression does not match any case
}
```

- The `expression` is evaluated once and its result is compared with the values specified in the `case` clauses.
- If a match is found, the code block associated with that `case` is executed. The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` block after executing the corresponding code. If `break` is omitted, execution will continue into the next case block.
- If no `case` matches the `expression`, the `default` case (if provided) will be executed.
- The `default` case is optional and serves as a catch-all if none of the other cases match.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = 'Monday';
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = 'Tuesday';
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = 'Wednesday';
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = 'Thursday';
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = 'Friday';
    break;
  case 6:
    dayName = 'Saturday';
    break;
  case 7:
    dayName = 'Sunday';
    break;
  default:
    dayName = 'Invalid day';
}

console.log(dayName); // Output: Wednesday
```

In this example, the `switch` statement assigns the appropriate day name to the variable `dayName` based on the value of the variable `day`.
